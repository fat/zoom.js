# ZOOM

A bit about our Image Zoom plugin: https://medium.com/designing-medium/image-zoom-on-medium-24d146fc0c20

Demo: https://fat.github.io/zoom.js

### HOW TO USE IT

+ Include `zoom.js` and `zoom.css` in your application. (note: zoom.js depends on [bootstrap's transition.js](https://raw.github.com/twbs/bootstrap/master/js/transition.js))
+ Add a `data-action="zoom"` attribute to the image tags you want to zoom.

### WHY TO USE IT

It's the best way to zoom an image. It transition/zooms in really cleanly, and then when you're done, scrolls away, [esc] keys away, clicks away… clean af.
